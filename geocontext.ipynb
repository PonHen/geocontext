    "# An introduction to <i>geocontext</i> \n",
    "### Pontus Hennerdal, January 2019\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook can be used for importing a CSV-file (<i>points</i>) and calculating the geographical context around each point in that file. The geographical context is the k-nearest neighbours in another CSV-file (<i>popLocations</i>, could also be the same file). If the values of the groups in the populated locations is higher then 1, the <i>geocontext</i> function calculates the proportion of the k-nearest neighbours being a part of this group. If the values is between 0 and 1, the function calculates a weighted average and standard deviation for each point among the k-nearest neighbours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the notion used in <i>Hennerdal & Nielsen (2017) http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2016.1261685</i>: If $t(x_{i})$ is defined as the total number of inviduals in the location $x_{i}$, we can express the calculation made by this script as statistics calculated for every set $N_{j,k}$ of locations $x_{i}$ located within the distance $r_{j,k}$ from $x_{j}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$N_{j,k} = \\left\\{x_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : | x_{i}-x_{j} | \\leq r_{j,k} \\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $r_{j,k}$ is the smallest possible but the the following criteria that the sum of individuals in the set of locations $N_{j,k}$ is the same or larger than the value $k$ is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k \\leq \\sum_{x_{i} \\in N_{j,k}}t(x_{i})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the same as calculating statistics (e.g. proportion or average and standard deviation) among the k-nearest neighbours for a set of locations.\n",
